Thank you for looking at our SE2 Final Project. 

There is one note that I must tell you. 
In the case that you run into an error in which maven will refuse to complile, 
the issue is most likely in the pom.xml file under "maven.compiler.source" and "maven.compiler.target".

These were originally set to 11, i believe but would not work on my personal machine so I was forced to change them,
please try setting those values to 11 or whichever version works for your machine if the error arises.
